# Network Issues Fix Summary

## Issues Identified
1. **Local Network Permission**: App was missing `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` which causes "Local network prohibited" errors
2. **App Transport Security**: Missing ATS configuration for HTTP connections to local Plex servers
3. **Network Reliability**: URLSession requests were getting cancelled due to poor error handling
4. **Pull-to-refresh Race Conditions**: Metadata loading tasks were conflicting during refresh

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Local Network Permission
- Added `INFOPLIST_KEY_NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` to both Debug and Release configurations
- This allows the app to access local network resources (Plex servers)

### 2. Added App Transport Security Configuration
- Added `INFOPLIST_KEY_NSAppTransportSecurity` with:
  - `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads = YES` (allows HTTP connections)
  - `NSAllowsLocalNetworking = YES` (specifically allows local network)

### 3. Improved Network Session Configuration
- Created custom URLSession with better timeout settings:
  - Request timeout: 15 seconds
  - Resource timeout: 30 seconds
  - `waitsForConnectivity = true` (waits for network to become available)
  - Allows cellular, expensive, and constrained network access

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling and Retry Logic
- Added retry mechanism in `fetchSessions()`:
  - Retries up to 3 times for network errors
  - Progressive delay (1s, 2s, 3s)
  - Only retries for specific network errors (connection lost, timeout, etc.)
  - Preserves original behavior for non-retryable errors

### 5. Improved Pull-to-Refresh Logic
- Cancels pending metadata tasks before refresh
- Clears current metadata to prevent stale data
- Resets session index properly
- Eliminates race conditions

## Testing Steps

1. **Clean Build**: Clean and rebuild the project to ensure Info.plist changes take effect
2. **Permissions**: On first launch, the app should request local network permission
3. **Network Reliability**: Pull-to-refresh should work consistently without "cancelled" errors
4. **Retry Logic**: Network interruptions should auto-retry instead of requiring app restart

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- ✅ App requests local network permission on first launch
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh works reliably without requiring app restart
- ✅ Network interruptions are handled gracefully with automatic retries
- ✅ Sessions load consistently without "cancelled" errors
- ✅ HTTP connections to local Plex servers work properly
