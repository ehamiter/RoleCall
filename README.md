### üé¨ IMDb Integration

The app integrates with a free IMDb API to provide enhanced cast and crew information:

- **No API Key Required**: Uses a free, public IMDb API service

### üîß Simple Setup

The app requires minimal configuration - no API keys needed:

1. **Plex Server Setup**:
   - Enter your Plex Media Server IP address in app settings
   - Login with your Plex credentials

That's it! The app uses a free IMDb API service that doesn't require registration or API keys.

### üîß Settings

1. **Configure Server IP**: Enter your Plex Media Server IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
2. **Save Settings**: Store your configuration for future use
3. **Logout**: Clear stored credentials and tokens

### üîê Authentication Flow

1. **Login Form**: Enter your Plex account credentials (username/email and password)
2. **Token Exchange**: App exchanges credentials for an X-Plex-Token with plex.tv API
3. **Token Storage**: Securely stores the token locally with expiration tracking
4. **Auto-Login**: On subsequent launches, checks if stored token is still valid

### üìä Server Capabilities

The app fetches and displays comprehensive server information including:

- **Server Information**: Name, version, platform details
- **MyPlex Integration**: Account status, subscription info
- **Media Capabilities**: Transcoding support, library features
- **Technical Details**: Platform version, machine identifier
- **Raw JSON**: View the complete API response

## No Configuration Required

### API Key-Free Architecture

This app uses a free, public IMDb API service that eliminates the need for API key management:

1. **No Registration**: No need to sign up for API access
2. **No Keys to Manage**: No API keys, tokens, or credentials required for movie data
3. **No Rate Limits**: Reasonable usage without strict rate limiting
4. **Simplified Deployment**: No configuration files or secrets to manage

The only credentials needed are your Plex server access (IP address and your existing Plex account).

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **SwiftUI**: Modern declarative UI framework
- **MVVM Pattern**: Clean separation of concerns
- **ObservableObject**: Reactive state management
- **UserDefaults**: Local storage for settings and tokens
- **URLSession**: HTTP networking for API calls

### Security
- Secure token storage using UserDefaults
- Token expiration tracking (30-day default)
- Automatic token validation on app launch
- Sensitive data clearing on logout

### Error Handling
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid credentials
- Server unreachable
- Token expiration
- Malformed responses

2. **Viewing Server Info**:
   - Once logged in, the app displays server capabilities
   - Tap "Refresh" to reload server information
   - Navigate through different sections to explore server features
   - View raw JSON response for technical details

3. **Managing Authentication**:
   - Settings shows connection status when logged in
   - Use "Logout" in settings to clear credentials
